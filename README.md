# Amblyopia Saber
A PC **Beat Saber** mod that allows you to adjust the visibility and positioning of notes for each eye individually.

Originally created by [@legoandmars](https://github.com/legoandmars), this mod was last updated over three years ago. Since then, I have taken over maintenance and will continue to update the project to keep it compatible with newer versions of Beat Saber.

All credits go to [@legoandmars](https://github.com/legoandmars) for developing the original mod.
